  This is the final result of a tournament with 81 players.

  If the gap is 431 elos, the weaker player will only win one game in thirteen.

  Let's take a closer look at player number 24, shown in green here.  
  In swiss he met the red players, with a spread of 431 elos.  
  The chance of the weaker player winning is less than 8%.  
  With ELO Pairing the spread is reduced to 50 elos.  
  The chance of the weaker winning here is 43%, a five fold increase.  
  Please note, in Swiss, this player never met any of his eight closest players.  
  
[E Swiss Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHRnlp8Q6RnnG-gF-fg0liyS2zZINEF5typxI497JyE/edit?gid=1809770193#gid=1809770193)

  The axes show the two players with the strongest players in the upper left corner.
  The weakest players can be found in the lower right corner.
  The games on the diagonal from the strong corner to the weak corner, have a low ELO gap.
  The other two corners are slaughter corners with a huge ELO gap.  
  The chance of winning in the slaughter corners,
  where the gap is 1000 elos, is 0.3%, one in 317 games.  
  As you can see, the games paired with Swiss, are spread all over the place.   
  
[F ELO Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHRnlp8Q6RnnG-gF-fg0liyS2zZINEF5typxI497JyE/edit?gid=830847657#gid=830847657)

  In this matrix, most games are very close to the main diagonal,  
  going from the strong corner down to the weak corner.
  Along this diagonal, the chance of winning is close to 50%, one in two games,  
  as the players have similar strength.

  As you can see, there are no games in the slaughter corners.  

In the next video I will show how it is possible to compare players with weighted ELO:s.
