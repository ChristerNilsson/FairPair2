The main reason for using Handicaps, is to produce unpredictable games.  
Even players will have more fun.  

Traditionally, these handicap variants have been used in chess:  

* *Material*, the stronger player plays without one piece
* *Moves*, the weaker player gets one or more extra moves in the opening
* *Opening*, the stronger player makes one or more weak moves
	* e.g. a4 or h4
* *Clock*, the weaker player gets extra time

The problem with these variants is, they are all unnatural.  

* Handicaps are common in the following sports, just to mention a few:
