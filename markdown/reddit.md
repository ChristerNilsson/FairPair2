A 30 minute video? We need a tldr. I hope it's not just "play with opponents with a similar rating".

Yes, in every sport teams play with teams of the same category, that's why the football (soccer) world cup have the groups divided by skills. If you don't want to play with higher rated played you can always play under-xxxx torunaments.

Replace the Swiss system with a pairing system that makes tournaments more balanced and exciting!

Neither the stronger nor the weaker player appreciates predictable games.
The Swiss system is unfair:
a win against a high-rated player is worth exactly
as much as a win against a low-rated player.

In boxing, a heavyweight never faces a flyweight. In chess, it's considered a privilege!

Principles for such a system:
a) Pair players with the same Elo rating, from the first to the last round.
b) Weight game points (1 or ¬Ω) with the opponent's Elo rating to determine standings.

Time to revive the old principle: Birds of a feather flock together!

This is at least the third time you posted the same in the last 24hs. You are surely very passionate about your bad idea.

Because, physics. A lesser skilled heavyweight can easily beat a more skilled flyweight simply because a single connected punch carries a lot more physical force. And the flyweight simply isn't going to hurt the heavyweight as much with a connected punch, due to more mass and muscle. I highly suggest you review Newton's second law -

Geez, it is easy to see why you cannot improve. Simply no basic logic at all. And no ability to Google simple answers to super basic questions.

You should prolly take a few weeks off from chess, then quit.

That's the thing, though. The outcome is NOT decided. Lower Elo players beat higher Elo players every day, all over the world. Your system would make it extremely hard to gain ratings points rapidly as a result of improvement. You need the opportunity to play higher rated players, in order to demonstrate your improvement and gain rating.

Your illogical thinking on this explains a lot. You can't improve, so you want to change the system. You don't think logically, which is the "reason" you cannot improve. It's a vicious circle...

I'm writing to you about the following submission: https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1dxfui0/-/

I‚Äôm astonished. I‚Äôm discussing my ideas about improving chess tournaments. I‚Äôm not the first person on this planet to notice the dark side of Swiss Dutch. Swiss has been around for 130 years and it is banned to discuss improvements. I am not making or intending to earn money on this. The software I linked is my own and it is freely available, the source as well.

This is one of my first posts on reddit and I don‚Äôt think I was insulting anyone or using a rude language.

I‚Äôm worried about the future of chess. It is so easy to find someone close in your elo and play on chess.com or lichess. I‚Äôm sick of paying fees for every otb tournament and not even being able to play against players of my own strength. I am not alone.

I guess I have to talk about other stuff 90% of my posts to continue here. I am a quite narrow minded person, discussing one subject at a time. That kind of person that actually transforms. I implemented Monrad in the 90‚Äôs before windows and internet. My program was used in all clubs in Stockholm for a decade.

I was happy having so much response, even if most of it was negative. Now that is taken away.

Thank you.
