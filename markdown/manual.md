# How to use the program

## Pages

The are four pages:
* Standings (The final listing ordered by Elo change)
* Tables    (shows where to sit and also used for entering results)
* Names     (shows where to sit alphabetically)
* Activity  (Pause and activate players)

Navigate between the pages by clicking with the mouse, using the letters **S**, **T**, **N**, **A** or **Left** and **Right** Arrow.

## Keys

These scrolling keys are available:  
**Up**, **Down**, **PageUp**, **PageDown**, **Home**, **End**   
You can also use the mouseWheel to scroll.  

## Zoom

* In and Out

## Printing the Table Sheets for entering results is recommended

The downloaded URL file is you primary backup.  
The sheets with all results are your secondary backup.  
You can handle a tournament without a printer, but it is not recommended for larger tournaments.  
After pairing, go to the Downloads section of your browser (**ctrl+j**) and open the top file.  
It contains Standings, Names and Tables.  
Print the file, and put up the alphabetical Name sheets, well separated, in the *same* positions every round.  

## Entering results

* As soon as a score sheet is completed, start entering the results, using the keyboard
* Use **1**, **space** or **0** to enter the results
* An erroneous result has to be deleted with the **Delete** key

## Enter results twice

Entering the same sheet twice, reduces mis-entering.  
Delete the red line before entering the correct result.  

## Standings
